# Calcalee
Side project in web developing.

The site integrates with an API of the stock market in U.S.
At the top of the site there is a stock search by letter (or first letters) of a stcok symbol.
At the second part of the website, the user can insert the stock symbol (which he looked for, or any other stock symbol he would like).
After the search the site will gather data about the stock, using the API, from the recent week.
Some of the data will be shown in a graph and the rest will be shown as labels above the graph.

In this project I used:
Javascript,
Json files,
API,
D3 Library,
Html,
CSS.
